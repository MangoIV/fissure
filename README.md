Fissure

My Choc-only split keyboard for desktop use with constant experiments. Current [keymap](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/99409a249d886554bd60af15782b2d50). 

You can find keymaps and gerber files for both versions if you want to build your own (I'm not used to version controlling PCB files, so if you have problems with them, please let me know). The firmware of this keyboard is based on [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). The PCB files are in `pcb/`, and firmwares in `qmk/`.
